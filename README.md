# Juan Luis Torres GitHub

Here is my GitHub profile. I am a Computer Engineering student interested in system security and protection, as well as server development and administration. On this GitHub, I have stored some projects I have worked on during my time at both the University of Granada and the University of CÃ´te d'Azur.

- Working on a Medium post about machine learning, another one about servers, another on Seed Labs, and working on my Bachelor's Thesis (TFG) on HPC and SRE.

## Projects

**[Practicas_Sistemas_Operativos](https://github.com/Torres08/Practicas_Sistemas_Operativos)**: Operating Systems exercises from ETSIIT UGR focused on design, management, and administration of processes, memory, file systems, I/O, security, and programming, with practical support through Makefiles. Exercises in C and terminal.

**[Practica_Docker_Servidores](https://github.com/Torres08/Practica_Docker_Servidores)**: Practices on High-Performance Web Servers using Docker, Apache, Nginx, and Kubernetes, with a focus on security, load balancing, benchmarking, and DDoS defense using a botnet, developed in Bash, YAML, and Python, with detailed documentation for each topic.

**[Paint_Java_SMM](https://github.com/Torres08/Paint_Java_SMM)**: Paint exercises in Java using NetBeans, focused on graphical interfaces, event handling, 2D graphics, image processing, sound, and video, with advanced challenges and problems with VCL libraries documented.

**[Practicas_Inteligencia_Artificial_2](https://github.com/Torres08/Practicas_Inteligencia_Artificial_2)**: Artificial Intelligence 2 exercise in C++, focusing on deliberative agents with depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost (CU), and A* search algorithms, as well as reactive and deliberative behaviors, sensor management, and dynamic route recalculation in the presence of obstacles.

**[Practicas_Sistemas_Concurrentes_Distribuidos](https://github.com/Torres08/Practicas_Sistemas_Concurrentes_Distribuidos)**: Concurrent and Distributed Systems exercises in C++, focused on multithreading, synchronization with semaphores and monitors, and communication via message passing with MPI, with exercises and templates organized by topics and Makefile support for compilation.

**[Practicas_OpenCV](https://github.com/Torres08/Practicas_OpenCV)**: OpenCV exercises in Python, including an interactive virtual pet with ArUco markers, 3D modeling (Pyrender and Trimesh), facial (face-recognition) and voice (Vosk, PyAudio) recognition, as well as exercises in Jupyter Notebooks on computer vision, machine learning, and SLAM with ROS.
